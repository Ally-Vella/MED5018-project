# MED5018-project of Group 6

This respository is for the final group project of the course MED5018, SUSTech. We tried to analyze the data of [COVID-19](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/covid-19-open-data/) from various aspects, including vaccinations, relations of some factors (i.e. sex, age, economy, smoking prevalence, diabetes prevalence) to mortality/new_confirmed/new_deceased, and clustering of another set of factors for possible commonality. 

The results are summarized briefly in the [document](doc/Summary.md).


## Instructions for group members
- Please download data into the `data/` folder (in local and don't submit them) and save figures into the `assets/` folder
- Save the code in corresponding folders, i.e. `code/direction1`, `code/direction2` or `code/direction3`
- If meet some problem when using git or github, check [using-github-tutorial](doc/using-github-tutorial.md) or refer to [Github official document](https://docs.github.com/zh/get-started/quickstart).
- After plotting, add some descriptions for the pictures in the corresponding README.md file if possible. (it's ok to write them in the .ipynb file)
