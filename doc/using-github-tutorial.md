Something in the front: `<...>` represents words that should be replaced according to the situation. E.g. my user name in the computer is 'lenovo', so my home directory is `C:\Users\lenovo\`

1. Follow the instructions in courseware of week13
	- download [Git](https://git-scm.com)
	- generate the public key and add it to your GitHub account
2. Generate token of github (to push your commit to github)
	- Settings - Developer settings - Personal access tokens - Tokens (classic)

3. Set password-less push (optional)
	- create `.git-credentials` in your home directory
		- if you are using windows, that should be `C:\Users\<your user name>`
	- fill in `https://<your github name>:<token>@github.com` in .gitcredentials
	- type `git config --global credential.helper store` in your terminal
		- you can do this in Git Bash
4. Now you have set up your computer to push your commit to our repository
	- First, `git clone https://github.com/Ally-Vella/MED5018-project.git`
		- And you can find the folder named `MED5018-project` in the directory
	- (I think using branches is too complicated for us, so let's just make our changes in the master branch) If you make some changes or add more files, add them using `git add <filename>`
	- then `git commit -m "some commit message"`, you can write what you have done in this commit here inside the quotation mark
	- after that, `git push` (if this is the first time you push, using `git push -u` instead)
	- Now you can find your changes in github!
	- **IMPORTANT!!** Everytime before you start your work, `git pull` first to get updated.
